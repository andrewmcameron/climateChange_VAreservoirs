## create and add new repositories in R

at least two ways to approach this:

a)  creating repository at GitHub website first

b)  creating repository from within R. This requires downloading GithubCLI first.

### a) after creating repository on website

in the terminal

```         
    $ git init
    $ git remote add origin https://github.com/your_username/your_repository_name.git
```

add files to staging area

```         
    $ git add .
```

commit added files

```         
    $ git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

push to GitHub

```         
    $ git push -u origin master`
```

### b) create repository in R

log in to GitHub through the CLI (one time action -- completed on mac OS sonoma on 2/20/24)

```
    $ gh auth login
```

initialize new Git repository; use GitHub CLI to create new repository on the website.
```
    $ git init
    $ gh repo create your_repository_name --public --source=.
```

 `source` is critical to set remote linking with GitHub. Defines this directory as local source for the project.


Replace your_repository_name with the desired name for your repository. Choose --public or --private to set the visibility of your repository. The --source=. option indicates that the current directory is the source for the new repository. If your project is already a Git repository and you have commits to push, you can immediately push to the new repository as prompted by the CLI.

push local repository to GitHub. 
```
    $ git push -u origin main

```
