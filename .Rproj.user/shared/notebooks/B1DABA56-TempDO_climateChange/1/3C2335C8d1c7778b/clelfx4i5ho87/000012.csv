"0","# The next step is to create a new variable in the Merged Profile & Meta Data dataset, which is the Temperature Anomaly. "
"0","# This is the difference between the observed temperature on a given date and the long-term average temperature. "
"0","# For example, for the first station (2-JKS044.60) the long-term mean surface T for May is 19.0, so you would subtract that from all May observations for this station (N=18). When the observed T is greater than mean T, this returns a positive number (above-average T), and when observed < average you get a negative anomaly."
